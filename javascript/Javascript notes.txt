This is just a text file. Too many comments can make code actually harder to read so I've put some of my comment notes in here.

Regarding the Google API

Placing this script after our normal javascript tag in the HTML will run the callback function (initMap) and draw a google map. it has async and defer so will not interrupt the flow of the rest of the HTML.
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/ss?key=AIzaSyCNpDZ-opNGQ_O4Tj5Fh9JaymUItYJ60b8&callback=initMap"
    async defer></script>
