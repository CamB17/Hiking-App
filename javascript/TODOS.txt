This is just a text file. Too many comments can make code actually harder to read so I've put some of my comment notes in here.

Regarding the Google API

Placing this script after our normal javascript tag in the HTML will run the callback function (initMap) and draw a google map. it has async and defer so will not interrupt the flow of the rest of the HTML.
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/ss?key=AIzaSyCNpDZ-opNGQ_O4Tj5Fh9JaymUItYJ60b8&callback=initMap"
    async defer></script>

This script is necessary for the autocomplete library provided by google:
	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyCNpDZ-opNGQ_O4Tj5Fh9JaymUItYJ60b8&libraries=places"></script>

Regarding the geocoding Google API
	Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

	The process of doing the opposite, translating a location on the map into a human-readable address, is known as reverse geocoding.

	The address tag is required. The street address that you want to geocode, in the format used by the national postal service of the country concerned. Additional address elements such as business names and unit, suite or floor numbers should be avoided.
